# HRMS Lite

## Project Overview

HRMS Lite is a lightweight Human Resource Management System designed to manage core HR data such as employees and attendance. The project follows a clean frontend–backend separation where a modern web UI communicates with a RESTful API built using FastAPI, and data is persisted in a PostgreSQL database.

The system currently supports:

* Creating and listing employees
* Recording and viewing attendance
* UUID-based identifiers for better security and scalability

This project is intended for learning, prototyping, and small internal HR tools.

## Tech Stack Used

### Backend

* **Python 3.13**
* **FastAPI** – REST API framework
* **SQLAlchemy** – ORM for database interaction
* **Pydantic** – Data validation and serialization
* **PostgreSQL** – Relational database
* **Uvicorn** – ASGI server

### Frontend

* **React** (Vite)
* **HTML / CSS / JavaScript**
* **Fetch API** for HTTP requests

### Tools

* **pgAdmin 4** – Database management
* **VS Code** – Development environment

---

## Steps to Run the Project Locally

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed:

* Python 3.10+
* PostgreSQL
* Node.js & npm
* Git

---

### 2️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd HRMS_A
```

---

### 3️⃣ Backend Setup

#### Create virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
```

#### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Configure Database

Create a PostgreSQL database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE hrms_db;
```

Update `database.py`:

```python
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://postgres:<password>@localhost:5432/hrms_db"
```

---

### 4️⃣ Run Backend Server

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Backend will run at:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

Swagger Docs:

```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

Tables (`employees`, `attendance`) are auto-created on startup.

---

### 5️⃣ Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

---

### 6️⃣ Test the Application

* Open the frontend in browser
* Fill employee form and submit
* Data is sent to backend and stored in PostgreSQL
* Verify using pgAdmin or `/employees` API

---

## Assumptions & Limitations

### Assumptions

* Application is run in **development mode**
* Database schema can be dropped and recreated if needed
* UUIDs are generated by backend (frontend does not send IDs)

### Limitations

* No authentication or authorization
* No role-based access control
* No pagination or filtering yet
* No database migrations (Alembic not added)
* Error handling is minimal (dev-focused)

---

## Future Enhancements

* User authentication & roles
* Alembic migrations
* Pagination & search
* Better error handling
* Deployment using Docker
